   9> Abstract classes, abstract methods, the Object class
1. Abstract Class
   1) declaring a class abstract means you cannot create objects from it
   2) creating : just add the word "abstract" to class declaration
   3) a class that is not abstract is concrete
2. Abstract Methods
   1) doesn't have a body
      ex) public abstract void eat();
   2) an abstract method must be overriden in the subclass
   3) if you declare an abstract method, you must make the class abstract as well
   4) can mix both abstract and concrete methods in an abstract class
3. casting reference types
   1) casting can also be used with reference types(objects)
   2) we can cast a reference type back to its real type
   ex) use casting to get a Dog object back from an ArrayList(list) that stores Objects

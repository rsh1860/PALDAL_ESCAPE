   10> Interfaces
1. Extending behavior
   1) Common behavior is defined by the methods inherited from the superclass
   2) Subclasses must follow that behaviour
2. "multiple inheritance(two or more superclasses)" is not possible in java
3. Interfaces
   1) Interface is like abstract class, except for that "All methods are abstract"
   2) A class that implements an interface, must overriden all of the interface's methods
   3) does not have constructor
   4) cannot create a new object
   5) interface is not extended by a class
   6) interface is implemented by a class
   7) cannot have instance variables

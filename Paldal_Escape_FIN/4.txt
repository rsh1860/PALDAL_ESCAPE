   8> Polymorphism
1. Polymorphism : 
   1) ability of an object to take many forms : "to have many forms"(form means type)
      ex) tiger can be either tiger, feline or animal
   2) after define a superclass, any subclass of that superclass can be used
   3) a reference variable and the object it refers to can be different types
2. why is Polymorphism important?
   1) can write code that doesn't have to change when you add new subclasses
   2) easily handle a collection different objects that have the same superclass
3. Overriding
   1) overriding = re-write a method that is inherited from superclass
   2) rules
      name of the method must be the same than in superclass
      parameters and return type must be the same
      the method cannot be less accessible

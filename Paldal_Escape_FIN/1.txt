  11> Static and final
1. Static methods
   1) Objects have state and behaviour, and their behaviour can depend on their states
   2) sometimes we need just behaviour without state
	- a method that acts only on the parameters
	- a method that doesn't depend on instance variables
	- static methods are associated with class instead of object
   3) don't need to create an object to call a static method
2. Static varialbes
   1) Static variavles store data that every object of the class can share
   2) if we don't give any value to a static variable, 
      it will get a default value(0, 0.0, null, false) when the class is loaded
3. Static final constant
   1) variable marked "final" means that it can never change after initialization
   2) by marking a variable both "static" and "final" we can have a class constant
   3) final is not just for static
